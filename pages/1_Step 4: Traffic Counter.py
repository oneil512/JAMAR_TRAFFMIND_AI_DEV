st.markdown("""
The **TraffMind AI Traffic Counter** is our next-generation tool tailored for accurate traffic counting and analysis. It features the capability to:
- **Generate count reports** based on the classification bins. This includes cars, trucks, buses, and other vehicle types identified in the traffic flow.
- **Specify time increments**: Customize how data is aggregated, whether by minute, hour, or day, to align with specific analysis needs.
- **Custom report templates**: Allows users to design reports that fit their particular requirements, making it easier to integrate data into existing workflows.

### Coming Soon!
We are excited to bring you this advanced feature. The TraffMind AI Traffic Counter is in the final stages of development and will soon help transform how traffic data is understood and utilized.
